EMIPLIB TODO list:

 * Make the RTP encoders and decoders compliant with standards. Currently,
   a simple ad hoc encoding scheme is used. This should obviously change.
 * Change the RTP encoder and decoder to make it possible to register
   specific codecs for specific payload types.
 * Add codec for audio and video.
 * In the MS-Windows version: change the project file to allow the file 
   mipqtoutput.moc to be generated automatically.
 * Make it possible to change the connections in a chain when it is
   already running.
 * Extend the audio mixer to allow messages other than floating point
   audio. This way, performance on embedded devices without FPU can
   be enhanced.
