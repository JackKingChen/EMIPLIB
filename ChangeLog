Version 0.10.0, March 2006:
 * Fixed bug in MIPAudioSession. In the GNU/Linux version, when the same
   OSS device was used for both input and output, there were some problems.
 * Added ESD audio output component.
 * Added 16 bit signed and unsigned raw audio messages using native byte
   order.
 * Modified the MIPSampleEncoder component. Now, an int32_t is used as an
   intermediate format instead of a float. This should speed things up on
   devices without FPU.
 * The MIPWAVReader can now also read samples as int16_t values (instead
   of only float values)
 * The MIPWAVInput component can now also produce samples as 16 bit (native
   byte order) audio messages.
 * Added Audio File Library audio input component.
 * The DirectShow webcam input component now allows the selection of a
   specific device (in case more than one is available).
 * The audio mixer and Speex components can now also use integer samples
   instead of floating point samples only.
 * Added a post-build batch file for the MS-Windows version which copies
   all the header files to an 'include' subdirectory.

Version 0.9.0, January 2006:
 * Initial release
